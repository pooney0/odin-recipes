        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 package rapid-rise yeast </li>
            <li>¾ cup warm milk</li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>¼ cup orange marmalade</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>½ cup old-fashioned oats</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h2><strong>Filling</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups chopped fresh cranberries </li>
            <li>6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 egg white </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h2><strong>Glaze</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon frozen orange juice concentrate </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water <em>or as needed</em></li>
        </ul>
            
        <h2<strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl; stir to dissolve. Add warm milk, egg, marmalade, and butter. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, oats, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to yeast mixture and stir until moistened. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine cranberries, brown sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until cranberries begin to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in walnuts, butter, and lemon juice. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down. Roll dough into a 10x20-inch rectangle on a floured surface.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg white and water together. Brush lightly over the dough. Spread cranberry filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Roll up tightly, starting from a long edge. Seal edges and cut off any tapered sides with no filling.</li>
            <li>Transfer roll to a large square baking sheet. Join ends together to form a ring. Use sharp kitchen shears to make cuts at 1-inch intervals, cutting 2/3 of the way through the dough. Twist each slice gently to expose the swirled filling. Gently shape dough into a perfect ring. Cover and let rise until doubled, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Stir powdered sugar and orange juice concentrate together in a small bowl. Add enough water to reach a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle glaze over tea ring. Allow glaze to set before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
