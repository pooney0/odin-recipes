In this project it's a simple recipe website. Very basic HTML usage. It will
have a few links and some ordered lists, along with some unordered lists. Later
on in my learning, I will be coming back to edit it CSS. So if you come across
with very boring and simple texts, you can see where I am at. If you see this
with it having designs and such, you will see I am further along my learning.
